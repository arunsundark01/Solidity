An entertainment industry has hired you as a Blockchain developer to create a decentralized movie rating application. You need to build a smart contract for movie ratings and test it on a local Blockchain network. 
Create a mapping field to store the movie reviews
Use an array to store the list of movies
Create a function that returns the total ratings a movie has received so far
Develop a constructor that will be called once you deploy the contract on Blockchain
Compile the smart contract using an IDE or a solidity compiler
Deploy it on Ropsten test network
